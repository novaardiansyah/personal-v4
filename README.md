# Personal Filament v4 Admin Panel

Hi Future Developer,

Welcome to the **Personal Filament v4 Admin Panel**! This project is an open-source admin panel built with the latest Laravel 12 and Filament PHP 4, designed for personal utility management and more.

This repository is the public evolution of my previous public admin panel project (originally developed with Laravel 12 and Filament PHP 3). Here, I’ve upgraded to Filament 4 and made the core features available for the community—ideal for learning, collaboration, or as a starting point for your own admin panel. To support public usage, user roles and permissions have been carefully separated and managed.

While this repository is public, please note that important configuration files such as `.env` and the application database are not provided. Although you can access and use the live version, access to the production database and sensitive configuration remains restricted for security reasons. However, I’m always open to discuss and help if you need guidance regarding configuration or setup.

## AI Automation Integration 🤖

This project features **AI-powered transaction recording** integrated with Telegram! Simply send a photo of your receipt or bill to the Telegram bot, and the AI will automatically:

- **Extract transaction data** from the image (amount, product/service, date, etc)
- **Categorize the transaction** (Expense, Income, Transfer, or Withdrawal)
- **Match payment accounts** based on receipt context or user hints
- **Create the transaction record** directly in your Personal Admin Panel
