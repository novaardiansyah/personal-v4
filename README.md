# Personal Filament v4 Admin Panel

Hi Future Developer,

Welcome to the **Personal Filament v4 Admin Panel**! This project is an open-source admin panel built with the latest Laravel 12 and Filament PHP 4, designed for personal utility management and more.

This repository is the public evolution of my previous public admin panel project (originally developed with Laravel 12 and Filament PHP 3). Here, I’ve upgraded to Filament 4 and made the core features available for the community ideal for learning, collaboration, or as a starting point for your own admin panel. To support public usage, user roles and permissions have been carefully separated and managed.
